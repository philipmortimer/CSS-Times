This repository contains the source code of the winning entry from the 2023 Bristol Art Hackathon: The CSS Times. The CSS Times is a satirical newspaper that publishes spoof stories centered around the University of Bristol and its Computer Science department. This website was awarded the top prize of Â£100 for the 2023 CSS Bristol Art Hackathon. I worked together with three other students over the course of a weekend to produce this submission.
