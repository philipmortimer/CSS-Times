  <p>
    Halett, known for his strict adherence to open-source software, was caught in the act by a group of computer science
     students who were in awe at the sight of their revered professor using a proprietary operating system.

const para3 = new Paragraph(
  <p>
    One student, who wished to remain anonymous, stated: "We were shocked. We always thought that Joseph lived 
    and breathed Linux. He's always preaching about the benefits of open-source software, and here he was using
    a Windows machine. It's like finding out Santa Claus isn't real."
  </p>,
  Paragraph.NO_PHOTO, Paragraph.NO_HEADING);

const para4 = new Paragraph(
  <p>
    When asked about the incident, Halett simply stated: "I needed to check my email, and my Linux machine was down for
     maintenance. I had no choice but to use a Windows machine. I swear, it's a one-time thing."
  </p>,

const para5 = new Paragraph(
  <p>
    However, sources close to Halett have stated that this isn't the first time he's used a Windows machine. It appears
     that Joseph has a secret love affair with proprietary software, and he just can't resist its alluring features and
     ease of use.

const para6 = new Paragraph(
  <p>
    The University of Bristol released a statement saying: "We support the use of open-source software, but we also understand
     that there may be times when our faculty may need to use proprietary software for specific tasks. We trust that Joseph
      Halett will continue to spread the gospel of open-source software, even if he does have a soft spot for proprietary 
      software."

const para7 = new Paragraph(
  <p>
    This news has sent shockwaves through the computer science community, and many are questioning if they can ever
     trust their lecturer again. But we at the University of Bristol have faith in Joseph, and we know that he'll return 
     to the Linux fold, stronger and more committed than ever.
